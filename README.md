# Quatro | Max Your Feelings
Rebranding Quatro brand.

"Quatro" was a fruit-flavored canned carbonated drink produced from 1982 to 1989 in the United Kingdom. Currently, has been sold and there is a new version commercialized in South-America by Coca-Cola Company

Our project is focus on rebranding Quatro, using a marketing strategy with a focus on Interactive Media Communications through the creation and development for the new website of the company.

For finishing this project our team divided the work in two parts, the first one was the design process, where we design the new visual identity, the brand guideline, and all graphic design related advertising, and the construction of a new website for the company.
